# Icon Changes for Chrome Extension

## Changes Made

To resolve the error:
```
Could not load icon 'images/icon16.png' specified in 'icons'.
```

I've modified the `manifest.json` file to remove the icon requirements. The following changes were made:

1. Removed the `default_icon` section from the `action` object
2. Removed the entire `icons` section

These changes allow the extension to load without requiring icon files.

## Adding Icons in the Future

If you want to add icons to your extension in the future, you can:

1. Create the following icon files:
   - `images/icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
   - `images/icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
   - `images/icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

2. Then add the following sections back to your `manifest.json` file:

```json
"action": {
  "default_popup": "popup.html",
  "default_icon": {
    "16": "images/icon16.png",
    "48": "images/icon48.png",
    "128": "images/icon128.png"
  }
},
"icons": {
  "16": "images/icon16.png",
  "48": "images/icon48.png",
  "128": "images/icon128.png"
},
```

## Creating Icon Files

You can create icon files using any of the methods described in the `images/standard_icons.txt` file:

1. Using a simple image editor to create colored squares
2. Downloading standard icons from icon websites
3. Using the HTML generator (`images/generate_icons.html`)
4. Converting the SVG icon (`images/icon.svg`) to PNG files

For now, the extension will work without icons, but adding them will improve the user experience by providing visual identification in the browser toolbar and extensions page.
