# Standard Icons for Chrome Extension

Since we're having trouble creating binary icon files directly, here are instructions to create standard icons for your Chrome extension:

## Option 1: Use Simple Colored Squares

1. Open an image editor like Paint, GIMP, or Photoshop
2. Create new images with the following dimensions:
   - 16x16 pixels (save as icon16.png)
   - 48x48 pixels (save as icon48.png)
   - 128x128 pixels (save as icon128.png)
3. Fill each image with a solid color (e.g., blue, green, or any color you prefer)
4. Save the images in PNG format with the exact filenames mentioned above
5. Place these files in the "images" directory of your extension

## Option 2: Download Standard Icons

You can download standard checkbox icons from various icon websites:

1. Visit one of these websites:
   - https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/checkbox
   - https://icon-icons.com/search/checkbox
   - https://www.iconfinder.com/search?q=checkbox

2. Download icons in the required sizes (16x16, 48x48, 128x128)
3. Rename them to match the required filenames (icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png)
4. Place these files in the "images" directory of your extension

## Option 3: Use the HTML Generator

You can use the generate_icons.html file we've already created:

1. Open the generate_icons.html file in a web browser
2. Right-click on each canvas and select "Save Image As..."
3. Save each image with the correct name (icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png)
4. Place these files in the "images" directory of your extension

## Option 4: Convert the SVG Icon

We've created an SVG icon (icon.svg) that you can convert to the required PNG files:

1. Open the icon.svg file in a web browser or image editor that supports SVG
2. Export or save the image as PNG in the following sizes:
   - 16x16 pixels (save as icon16.png)
   - 48x48 pixels (save as icon48.png)
   - 128x128 pixels (save as icon128.png)
3. Place these files in the "images" directory of your extension

You can also use online converters like:
- https://svgtopng.com/
- https://convertio.co/svg-png/
- https://cloudconvert.com/svg-to-png

After adding these icon files, your extension should load correctly.
