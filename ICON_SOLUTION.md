# Chrome Extension Icon Solution

## Problem
The Chrome extension was failing to load with the error:
```
Could not load icon 'images/icon48.png' specified in 'icons'.
```

## Solution
We've provided multiple ways to create the required icon files:

1. **SVG Template**: We've created an SVG icon file (`images/icon.svg`) that can be converted to the required PNG files.

2. **Detailed Instructions**: We've created a text file (`images/standard_icons.txt`) with four different methods to create the required icon files:
   - Creating simple colored squares using an image editor
   - Downloading standard icons from icon websites
   - Using the HTML generator (`images/generate_icons.html`)
   - Converting the SVG icon to PNG files

3. **Helper Files**:
   - `images/generate_icons.html`: An HTML file that generates the icons directly in the browser
   - `images/create_icons.js`: A Node.js script that can generate the icons
   - `images/icon.svg`: An SVG template of a checkbox icon

## Required Files
The extension needs the following icon files in the `images` directory:
- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

## Next Steps
1. Choose one of the methods described in `images/standard_icons.txt`
2. Create the three required icon files
3. Place them in the `images` directory
4. Load the extension again in Chrome

After adding these icon files, the extension should load correctly.
